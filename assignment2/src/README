Our code depends on the following python libraries:
numpy
pylab (matplotlib >= 1.2.0)
Python Imaging Library


The following command, included for convenience, should install all dependencies on
debian/ubuntu-based systems:
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-imaging
sudo pip install matplotlib
